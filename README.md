# Event-Management-App

This is my first Java Console based application. This application is run only in terminal/commandline.
This application records the event attendees and event details like the day, event name and event ID. 
The application demonstrates CRUD operations, and additionally saves the details even if the console is closed and opened again. 

Improvement needs in the area of clean coding and not repeating yourself. Packaging and file handling needs to be improved
creating more classes and methods to reuse them needs to be implemented more
